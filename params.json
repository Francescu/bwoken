{"name":"Bwoken","body":"Runs your UIAutomation tests from the command line for both iPhone and iPad.\r\n\r\nSupports coffeescript.\r\n\r\n![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bendyworks/bwoken.png?branch=master)\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.github.com/bendyworks/bwoken/master/doc/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nMake sure bwoken is properly installed via one of the methods below. Then, build your project and run all your tests via:\r\n\r\n    $ rake\r\n\r\nTo run a single file, add a RUN variable relative to `integration/coffeescript/`, ignoring the file extension:\r\n\r\n    $ RUN=iphone/focused_test rake\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation with rvm (recommended)\r\n\r\nEnsure Xcode is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nAdd an .rvmrc file to your project, such as:\r\n\r\n    $ echo 'rvm use 1.9.3@MyProject --create' >> .rvmrc\r\n\r\nInstall bundler and init:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install bundler\r\n    $ bundle init\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'bwoken'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle --binstubs=bundler_bin\r\n\r\nEnsure your after_cd_bundler rvm hook is enabled:\r\n\r\n    $ chmod u+x ~/.rvm/hooks/after_cd_bundler\r\n\r\nThen, add the following line to your `Rakefile`:\r\n\r\n    require 'bwoken/tasks'\r\n\r\nInitialize your bwoken file structure:\r\n\r\n    $ rake bwoken:init\r\n\r\nEnsure your project is in a workspace rather than simply a project:\r\n\r\n* In Xcode, select File -> Save as workspace...\r\n* Save the workspace in the same directory as your .xcodeproj file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation without rvm (not recommended)\r\n\r\nEnsure Xcode is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nInstall bundler and init:\r\n\r\n    $ gem install bundler\r\n    $ bundle init\r\n\r\nAdd this line to your application's Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'bwoken'\r\n\r\nAnd then execute:\r\n\r\n    $ bundle --binstubs=bundler_bin\r\n\r\nEnsure your $PATH variable has bundler_bin at the front. This is usually done with .bash_profile:\r\n\r\n    $ echo 'export PATH=bundler_bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile\r\n\r\nThen, add the following line to your `Rakefile`:\r\n\r\n    require 'bwoken/tasks'\r\n\r\nInitialize your bwoken file structure:\r\n\r\n    $ rake bwoken:init\r\n\r\nEnsure your project is in a workspace rather than simply a project:\r\n\r\n* In Xcode, select File -> Save as workspace...\r\n* Save the workspace in the same directory as your .xcodeproj file\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1.
